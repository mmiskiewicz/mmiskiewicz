<p>👋 Thanks for swinging by! I'm Mateusz and I really do appreciate your taking the time to get acquainted with my profile!</p>
<p></p>
<p>It's such a cliché, but I've been passionate about programming since I was a little kid 👶 I still vividly remember the time when I was running a website dedicated entirely on Worms video game series 🎮 (if you haven't played it, please do, because it's awesome!). I had 5 active users (at best) on daily basis and I felt like I was on top of the world. Don't get any ideas. I'm not going to share it with you, because I'd be embarrassed 😅 </p>
<p>Fast forward a couple years later (as I was playing Worms less and less unfortunately), I realized that programming and doing computer stuff 💻 is something that I actually love doing 🤍 I felt really lucky, because not everybody gets a chance to make a living from a passion. I didn't want to mess this up, so I've decided to fully pursue my dreams, which resulted in my educational journey being a long and winding road 🎹 (pun intended).</p>
  <p>I've recently started being more active around here as I've just graduated from Gdańsk University of Technology 🎓 There's a lot of exciting things I'm working on and I can't wait to share them with you! In the meantime, please take a look around and check out some of my projects. <a href="https://github.com/mmiskiewicz/M-Store">M-Store</a> is probably one of the most interesting ones at the moment, so you'd probably want to take a peek that one 👀 While it ain't perfect, it does show that I have a good grasp of backend development and Python in general 🐍 Oh, and also don't hesitate to shoot me an email or give me a call as I'm currently looking for exciting job opportunities! 💼 You just went through all that text, so you might as well reach out to me!</p>

Have a good one!
<p>Mateusz</p>
